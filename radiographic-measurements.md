# Key Radiographic Measurements in Hip Dysplasia

This guide explains the essential radiographic measurements used in the diagnosis and assessment of hip dysplasia. Understanding these measurements is crucial for accurate interpretation of pelvic radiographs.

## 1. Lateral Center-Edge (LCE) Angle

### Definition
The LCE angle measures the lateral coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum. It is formed by two lines on an anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the pelvis:
- A vertical line through the center of the femoral head (drawn perpendicular to the transverse pelvic axis).
- A line from the center of the femoral head to the lateral edge of the acetabulum.

### Normal Values
- **Normal**: ≥ 25°
- **Borderline**: 20°–25°
- **Dysplastic**: < 20°

### Measurement Technique
1. Identify the center of the femoral head.
2. Draw a vertical line through the center, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body.
3. Draw a second line from the center to the most lateral point of the acetabular sourcil (weight‑bearing zone).
4. Measure the angle between the two lines.

### Clinical Significance
A decreased LCE angle indicates insufficient lateral coverage, a hallmark of acetabular dysplasia. Values below 20° are strongly associated with early osteoarthritis and instability.

## 2. Acetabular Index (AI) / Tonnis Angle

### Definition
The acetabular index quantifies the inclination of the acetabular roof. It is the angle between a horizontal line connecting the two tear‑drops (or the base line of the pelvis) and a line drawn along the acetabular roof (sourcil) to the lateral margin of the acetabulum.

### Normal Ranges
- **Children (≤ 8 years)**: < 30°
- **Adolescents and adults**: < 10°–12° (varies by age)
- **Dysplastic**: > 10°–12° in adults

### How to Measure on an AP Pelvis Radiograph
1. Draw the horizontal reference line connecting the inferior margins of both tear‑drops (or the lowest points of the ischial tuberosities if tear‑drops are not visible).
2. Draw a line along the acetabular sourcil from the medial to the lateral edge.
3. Measure the angle between the two lines.

### Interpretation
A higher AI indicates a steeper, more vertical acetabulum, which reduces anterior and lateral coverage of the femoral head.

## 3. Break in Shenton's Line

### What is Shenton's Line?
Shenton's line is a smooth, continuous arc formed by the medial border of the femoral neck and the superior border of the obturator foramen on an AP pelvis radiograph.

### Identifying Disruption
- In a normal hip, the line is unbroken.
- In hip dysplasia (or other conditions such as subluxation/dislocation), the arc is disrupted—the femoral neck border no longer aligns with the obturator foramen border.

### Implications
A broken Shenton's line suggests superior migration of the femoral head, indicating instability, subluxation, or frank dislocation. It is a sensitive but non‑specific sign of hip pathology.

## 4. Acetabular Depth Ratio

### Definition
The acetabular depth ratio evaluates the depth of the acetabulum relative to its width. It is calculated as the distance from the femoral head center to the floor of the acetabulum divided by the distance from the femoral head center to the lateral acetabular edge.

### Normal Values
- Normal ratio is approximately 0.25–0.35.
- A ratio < 0.25 suggests a shallow acetabulum.

### Measurement Steps
1. Locate the center of the femoral head.
2. Measure the horizontal distance from the center to the lateral acetabular edge (L).
3. Measure the horizontal distance from the center to the medial acetabular floor (M).
4. Depth ratio = M / L.

### Clinical Relevance
A shallow acetabulum (low depth ratio) provides less containment for the femoral head, increasing contact pressures and risk of early degenerative changes.

## Common Pitfalls in Measurement
- **Rotation of the pelvis**: Ensure a standard AP view with symmetric obturator foramina and aligned sacrum.
- **Incorrect identification of the acetabular sourcil**: Use the weight‑bearing portion, not the lateral osseous edge.
- **Misplacement of the femoral head center**: Use a transparent template or geometric construction for accuracy.
